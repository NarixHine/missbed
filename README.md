## Usage

### Use `missbed.narix.link`

Embed a note or a timeline of a user using `<iframe>`ã€‚

You can read your own UID in `Settings - Other`.

```html
<iframe src='https://missbed.narix.link/timeline/{instance}/{user_id}' />

<iframe src='https://missbed.narix.link/timeboard/{instance}/{user_id}' />

<iframe src='https://missbed.narix.link/note/{instance}/{note_id}' />
```

### Deploy your own

`missbed.narix.link` uses `@vercel/analytics` for analysis and no token for retrieving Misskey data. You can fork this repo, customise `pages/_app.tsx`, `lib/misskey.ts` as well as other related files, and deploy your modified version. Or simply click this button to deploy on Vercel directly.
